# Contribution Guidelines

We love to see contributions to the project and have tried to make it easy to do so. If you would like to contribute code to this project you can do so through GitHub by forking the repository and sending a pull request.

Before Comcast merges your code into the project you must sign the [Comcast Contributor License Agreement (CLA)](https://gist.github.com/ComcastOSS/a7b8933dd8e368535378cda25c92d19a).

If you haven't previously signed a Comcast CLA, you'll automatically be asked to when you open a pull request. Alternatively, we can e-mail you a PDF that you can sign and scan back to us. Please send us an e-mail or create a new GitHub issue to request a PDF version of the CLA.

## Testing

## Pull Requests

* should be from a forked project with an appropriate branch name
* should be narrowly focused with no more than 3 or 4 logical commits
* when possible, address no more than one issue
* should be reviewable in the GitHub code review tool
* should be linked to any issues to which it relates (i.e. issue number after (#) in commit messages or pull request message)

Expect a thorough review process for any pull requests that add functionality or change the behavior of the application. We encourage you to sketch your approach in writing on a relevant issue (or creating such an issue if needed) before starting to code, in order to save time and facilitate communication.
